In order to keep data clean, employees would have to follow a pipeline in order for the machine to read in information

Here are the list of things to take in consideration before using this machine:
1) check the number of weekday and weekend for security
2) check the month number on manager file (change every month)
3) data cleaning, mase sure the employee follow the instruction for data input

IMPORTANT: the input file is not included here since it is private to SkyFitness ONLY

After this, everything should be working. Feel free to reach out for any questions!
